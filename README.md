This is a portfolio-repository for my career as a software developer. A list of my projects can be found [here](#projects-).

## About me ‚õ∑Ô∏è

I am a newly graduated sofware developer from [JAMK University of Applied Sciences](https://www.jamk.fi/en). In the first half of 2025 I spent six months as a developer intern at G-Tronic Oy, where I worked on the internal ERP-system, in a fullstack role mainly with Python, JavaScript (+ JQuery) and MariaDB. Some notable new features I created during the internship were a warehouse management system, bidding platform for material orders and a tool for handling order packaging and collection. During the rest of my studies I gathered a wide set of skills on web-development and I specialized myself in fullstack-development, mainly on JavaScript and its relating technologies.

As a developer, I am an independent worker, and have great self-management skills, but I also work well within a team. I love solving problems and challenging myself with new things. I also really like learning new skills, and do so constantly. I have a strong drive to produce high quality, maintainable code, for example with reusability and clarity of code, and efficient documentation. I also pay attention to clarity and efficiency within general communication in a dev-team, as I believe it is a key component for successful teamwork.
